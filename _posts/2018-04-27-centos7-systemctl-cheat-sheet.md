Since CentOS7, command `service` has been changed to `systemctl`.  For a while I was very repel to it cause I was new and not used to it at all.  Though that `service` is still usable in CentOS7 but after I thought, what the hell, why not learn and get used to something new?  Therefore, this article is produced as reference, for me and anyone else who is also struggling to learn and unfamiliar with `systemctl` like me.

Before we start, please note that systemctl not only can manage **service** but also **path**, **slice**, **snapshot**, **socket**, **swap**, **target** and **timer**.  And they are called `unit files`.

## Gathering systemd information
First of all, we can use help to list all the usages.
```
systemctl -h
```
![systemctl](/assets/images/2018042601.jpg)

It is important to know/list out all the installed unit files.
```
systemctl list-unit-files
```
![systemctl](/assets/images/2018042603.jpg)

`static` means it can't be start or stop like a `service`.  static unit files are mostly a "one time job" or is depended by other unit files.

Unit files name can be added for particular query.
```
systemctl list-unit-files sshd.service
```
![systemctl](/assets/images/2018042604.jpg)

Listing out the status of all the unit files.
```
systemctl list-units
```
![systemctl](/assets/images/2018042602.jpg)

Listing out the status of a particular unit file.
```
systemctl list-units sshd.service
```
![systemctl](/assets/images/2018042605.jpg)

Both systemctl list-units and systemctl list-unit-files can be appended with --type for particular type of unit file.
```
systemctl list-units --type=target
systemctl list-unit-files --type=path
```
![systemctl](/assets/images/2018042608.jpg)

Among all the unit file types, socket has it's own command to list out.
```
systemctl list-sockets
```
![systemctl](/assets/images/2018042609.jpg)

Show a unit's dependencies.
```
systemctl list-dependencies crond.service
```
![systemctl](/assets/images/2018042606.jpg)

{% include ads3.html %}

## Working with services
Commands to start, stop and showing status.
```
systemctl stop crond
systemctl status crond
systemctl start crond
```
![systemctl](/assets/images/2018042610.jpg)
<br>![systemctl](/assets/images/2018042611.jpg)

Commands to reload, restart.
```
systemctl reload crond
systemctl restart crond
```
![systemctl](/assets/images/2018042612.jpg)
<br>![systemctl](/assets/images/2018042613.jpg)

Commands to enable and disable service at system start up.
```
systemctl disable crond
systemctl enable crond
```
![systemctl](/assets/images/2018042614.jpg)
<br>![systemctl](/assets/images/2018042615.jpg)

From the image we learn that to start or stop a service is actually just putting or removing a symlink of the unit file at `/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/` directory.

A quick peep of `/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/` directory.
<br>![systemctl](/assets/images/2018042619.jpg)

Checkout the current runlevel where `multi-user.target` equals to runlevel init 3.
```
systemctl get-default
```
![systemctl](/assets/images/2018042620.jpg)

Commands to change runlevel.
```
systemctl set-default graphical.target
```
![systemctl](/assets/images/2018042621.jpg)

We can tell from the message that the runlevel is also a symlink linked to default.target.

## Viewing log messages
Lastly, command to view all service logs.
```
journalctl
```
![systemctl](/assets/images/2018042618.jpg)

To view log of particular service.
```
journalctl -u crond.services
```
![systemctl](/assets/images/2018042617.jpg)

To view the real time log.  The image shows the real time log pop out when I try to login the demo server.
```
journalctl -f
```
![systemctl](/assets/images/2018042616.jpg)
